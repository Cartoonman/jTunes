# jTunes
Software Design Lab—Final Project

jTunes, a Java-based version of iTunes. Using SQL Database to store information on songs, and has built-in audio playback functionality.

<h2>Project Description:</h2> <p>jTunes is an application that is essentially an audio player that lets you search for songs in a database based on genre, artist, albumname, and song name, and play the song for you, with full playback functionality. 
Our project in particular used JavaFX, a very new Java library that ships with Java as of Java 8, that allows us to play mp3 files. To run our program you MUST have at least Java 8 installed.</p>

<h3>Instructions:</h3> <p>We have attached one .jar file, which is the main application. To run this app, you may simply click on it, or if you wish to see more detailed debug info, run it in console with the command ‘java –jar jTunes.jar’. 
Note that it may take a while at the start to boot up because it will have to generate a database on your computer. Note that we have set our login information as the following:<br>
<b>Username: root<br>
Password:</b> <br><br>
There is no password. If you have a password on your MySQL database, use command <code>SET PASSWORD FOR 'root'@'localhost' = PASSWORD('');</code> to blank the password so you can run our application. </p>
